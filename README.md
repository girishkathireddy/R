## Scatter Plot ##

![Alt text](SC.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

* The scatter plot provides information about Apples total supply, exports, imports, percapita use in US over a period of 30 years.
* Through this graph we can understand the co-relation between different attributes like (exports, total supply), (exports, imports) and so on.
* From this Graph we can see that positive linear correlation between (imports, totalsupply).
* The total supply of Apples and percapita has been widespread and stands unique in the chart through which we can say there is little or no correlation. (exports, percapita), (exports, totalsupply) also has little correlation between them.
* Clearly Nonlinear correlation exists between (imports, exports), (imports, percapita).

## Line Chart ##

![Alt text](Line.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

* The line chart has year on x axis and Total Supply of Apples in million pounds on y axis.
* The chart provides information about the total supply of Apples in the United States with the time interval of every ten years.
* This information is best represented in line chart since we can understand the variations in supply of Apples with time very easily.
